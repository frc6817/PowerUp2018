To build the code onto the RoboRIO:

Commit all code to remote repo @ either: 
origin/master (ONLY IF WORKING AND DEBUGGED CODE)
origin/develop (EVERYTHING ELSE)

Then, go to the driver station.
Clone and/or pull all the code from whichever branch you committed to.
Then, open powershell.
cd into the git directory, BUT NO FURTHER.
Plug into the RoboRIO
run ./gradlew deploy.
This should work. If not, consult the Open-RIO github and read the readme.
