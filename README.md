# FIRST Team 6817, 10 Factorial

FRC Team 6817's repository for FIRST FRC Power Up.

Our code is for the [FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc). [FIRST](https://www.firstinspires.org/) is a non-profit organization that promotes the ideas of STEM and Gracious Professionalism- robotics competitions are a medium to carry forth these ideas.

This year's challenge is Power Up! Catch us at Greater Kansas City 3/14/18 to 3/17/18! To view this year's challenge video, click the image to view a video:
